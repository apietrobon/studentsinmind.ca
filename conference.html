            <p>As students get caught up in the demands of university life, we often overlook mental health as an integral component of our well-being. <strong>Students in Mind</strong> is an annual mental health conference taking place at McGill. If mental health has touched your life or sparked your interest in any way, we invite you to join us on <strong>October 5th, 2014</strong> for a dynamic conversation on issues ranging from self-care and stigma to peer support and advocacy.</p>

            <p>Students in Mind is open to and intended for all McGill students. The conference will take place in the <strong>SSMU building</strong>. There is a <strong>$6 on-line registration fee</strong> (or $5 if you get a ticket during tabling hours on campus). The fee is the same for all attendees and includes lunch, coffee and snacks.</p>

                        As a registered attendee, you will have the opportunity to attend two workshops on the day of the conference. During these sessions you will gain the knowledge and skills to manage your personal mental health, support peers who may be dealing with mental health problems, and potentially get involved in mental health initiatives both on- and off-campus. Our workshops have been developed in collaboration with existing McGill student services: Counselling Services, Mental Health Services, the Office for Students with Disabilities, and Student Health Services. The workshops will centre on the two themes of self-care and peer support.
                        <H4><strong>Self-Care Workshop</strong></H4>
                        The self-care workshop will focus on developing an awareness of one`s thoughts, emotions, beliefs, and behaviours` and work towards creating an individualized plan to maintain and improve self-care. Attendees will:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assess their current level of self-care</li>
                            <li>Become aware of their mind and body</li>
                            <li>Find ways to incorporate self-care into their daily lifestyle</li>
                        </ul>
                        It is our hope that, through this workshop, you will leave the Students in Mind conference with tangible skills to promote mental wellness for yourself and amongst your peers!

                        <H4><strong>Mental Health/Illness and Criminality</strong></H4>
                        <p>Are people who have mental illnesses responsible for their actions? Alternatively, are people who commit unprompted murder ever mentally healthy? There is substantive evidence of the over-representation of people with various forms of mental illnesses in the criminal justice system. What are some processes that could be put into place that acknowledge and mitigate barriers for people with mental health disabilities? The broader purpose of this panel discussion is to mitigate the negative stigma surrounding mental illness. What kinds of societal/institutional changes can be implemented in order to minimize the marginalization of people with mental disabilities, and what are the respective roles of the mental health system and the criminal justice system in bringing about such changes?</p>

                        <p>This panel centers around themes such as the culture of diagnosis in North America, the perception of normality and the perception of happiness, and how to respond to diversity in mental health care. Perspectives from Transcultural Psychiatry, a discipline evaluating the cultural underpinnings of our conceptions of mental health and illness, will be considered. The discussion will also revolve around the topic of psychiatric community care: To what extent does community acceptance, inclusion and the sense of belonging have a healing effect? How does perception of normality affect community acceptance and inclusion?</p>

                        <H4><strong>The Impact of Social Media on Mood</strong></H4>
                        <p>How does social media affect the mood? Scientists have suggested that negative posts on Facebook have a domino effect. On the other hand, the idea that there is a social desirability bias in Facebook posts also prevails: people tend to over-represent positive aspects of their lives and under-represent negative ones. In general, what is the impact of social media on people's self-image and self-esteem? In this panel, the discussion will also revolve around the various ways in which we can use social media as a platform of information and discussion about mental health, and how it can be used to promote and encourage healthier habits. (NB. Healthy McGill's SelfCareChallenge, Humans of New York's portraits of people with both happy and sad life stories, The Quebec Charter for a Healthy and Diverse Body Image).</p>

                        <p>What can we do to improve mental health on campus? What are ways in which we can build a more supportive and inclusive campus environment? Specifically, given that we are faced with high levels of anxiety and depression, what can we do to alleviate the stress placed on students? In this panel, we will discuss concrete strategies that can be implemented with an eye to creating a healthier campus – e.g. more interactive and diverse classroom experiences, flexible exam schedules, listing of services on McGill syllabi, etc. We will also discuss the role of McGill Mental Health Services and Counselling services in building a more supportive campus, and how existing student-led initiatives fit in the spectrum of mental health care on campus.</p>
