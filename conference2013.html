            <p>As students caught up in the demands of university life, we often overlook mental health as an integral component of our well-being. Student mental health is a conversation that needs to take place across our campus, and it starts with <strong>Students in Mind</strong>, the first student-run conference on mental health at McGill.  If mental health has touched your life or sparked your interest in any way, we invite you to join us on <strong>October 5th, 2013</strong> for a dynamic conversation on issues ranging from self-care and stigma to peer support and advocacy.</p>

            <p>Students in Mind is open to and intended for all McGill students. The conference will take place in the <strong>SSMU building</strong>, and there is a <strong>$5 registration fee</strong> for all attendees, which includes lunch.</p>

                        As a registered attendee, you will have the opportunity to attend two workshops on the day of the conference. During these sessions you will gain the knowledge and skills to manage your personal mental health, support peers who may be dealing with mental health problems, and potentially get involved in mental health initiatives both on- and off-campus. Our workshops have developed in collaboration with existing McGill student services: Counselling Services, Mental Health Services, the Office for Students with Disabilities, and Student Health Services. The workshops will centre on the two themes of self-care and peer support.
                        <H4>Self-Care Workshop</H4>
                        The self-care workshop will focus on mental health education and specific self-care methods. You will:
                        <ul>
                            <li>strengthen your knowledge of mental health basics</li>
                            <li>learn about resourcecs available both at McGill and in Montreal</li>
                            <li>discover essential methods (e.g. stress management) for caring for your own mental health amid the demands of university life</li>
                            <li>develop your personal self-care plan</li>
                        </ul>
                        It is our hope that, through this workshop, you will leave the Students in Mind conference with tangible skills to promote mental wellness for yourself and amongst your peers!

                        As a registered attendee, you will have the opportunity to attend two workshops on the day of the conference. During these sessions you will gain the knowledge and skills to manage your personal mental health, support peers who may be dealing with mental health problems, and potentially get involved in mental health initiatives both on- and off-campus. Our workshops have developed in collaboration with existing McGill student services: Counselling Services, Mental Health Services, the Office for Students with Disabilities, and Student Health Services. The workshops will centre on the two themes of self-care and peer support.
                        <H4>Peer Support Workshop</H4>
                        The peer support workshop will train you to engage with your peers in a way that encourages both help-seeking and helping behaviour. You will:
                        <ul>
                            <li>gain new support skills and reinforce existing ones</li>
                            <li>be challenged to apply new skills in real-life scenarios</li>
                            <li>learn how to talk to a peer in distress and develop active listening skills</li>
                            <li>define the mental health needs of your campus and brainstorm potential solutions to these needs</li>
                        </ul>
                        It is our hope that, through this workshop, you will leave the Students in Mind conference with tangible skills to promote mental wellness for yourself and amongst your peers!

                        Afflicting one percent of the adult population with devastating hallucinations, delusions and social impairment, schizophrenia has long been known to have a genetic component. Ridha Joober, MD, PhD, joined the Douglas Institute in 1999 and has since made significant contributions in unveiling the genetic basis of schizophrenia and ADHD. As a major research focus, Ridha Joober investigates the relationship between genetic variations and neuropsychological and behavioural traits in patients with schizophrenia and ADHD as well as the response of these disorders to pharmacological treatment. Ridha Joober's recent work has focused on the environmental factors involved in ADHD, particularly maternal smoking during pregnancy. This research has led to the development of more precise pharmacogenetic and environmental profiles of schizophrenia and ADHD that may ultimately lead to the earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment of these psychiatric disorders. Throughout his career, Ridha Joober has received a number of awards and distinctions, including the 2002 <em>Young Investigator Award</em> from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), a <em>Senior Research Scholar Award</em> from the Fonds de recherche en sant&eacute; du Qu&eacute;bec (FRSQ), and the <em>Sam Lal Award</em> from the Graham Boekh Foundation and the Canadian College of Neuropsychopharmacology (CCNP). Dr. Joober is also a member of the steering group based in Montreal for the Transformational Research in Adolescent Mental Health (TRAM), a call that has gone out to all service providers and scientists in Canada to create a transformation of mental health services for youth (11-25 years). This TRAM steering group is seeking your full participation to collectively plan and shape this initiative in the interest of achieving a much needed revolution in the way youth mental health services are delivered.

                        Keven is a recent graduate from the Honours Psychology program at McGill University, and is passionate about promoting psychological well-being and encouraging collaboration between people. Having both personal and research experience in depression, he volunteered with the Anxiety Support and Awareness Community, a group providing peer support to students suffering from mental health conditions at McGill. Later, he completed an internship at the Counselling Center of Vanier College, where he played a key role in designing and implementing a college-wide intervention against sexual assault. Having a keen interest in research, he recently joined the Psychosocial Oncology Lab at the Jewish General Hospital, where he assists studies that look at the factors that influence people's decisions to vaccinate against the Human Papillomavirus. With a passion in applying psychological findings, Keven continuously seeks to incorporate research on influence and decision-making in order to promote not only psychological well-being, but also the development of supportive and collaborative communities. He recently founded the Association for Well-Being and Enrichment, an initiative promoting collaboration between mental health groups in order to provide a more unified resource for students struggling with mental health and other difficulties.

                        Dr. Low is a clinician-researcher in the Mood Disorders Program of the MUHC and Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at McGill University. She is a psychiatrist with training in psychiatric and genetic epidemiology and interested in familial risk in psychiatric disorders. Her research focuses on mood and anxiety disorders and other complex, chronic disorders. She uses (a) family and (b) longitudinal cohort study approaches to characterize (1) the phenotypic heterogeneity of what is transmitted within families; (2) the factors that contribute to the familial transmission, such as other psychiatric comorbidity, genetic factors, and the source of subject sampling; and (3) the role of environmental exposures on the course, progress, and outcomes of illness. Dr. Low also uses (4) comorbid disorders (e.g., migraine, sleep, cardiovascular diseases) to derive and evaluate possible familial phenotypes of psychiatric disorders.

                        Advances in our understanding of environmental influences and molecular biology on neuronal and psychological development have allowed for the creation of more sophisticated and valid models of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Joseph Rochford, PhD and his team in the Neurophenotyping Centre provide consultation and phenotyping services to all members of the scientific community of Quebec and Canada interested in assessing the behavioural impact of genes, the environment, and their interaction. Joseph Rochford is also actively involved in educational and training initiatives. He is the University Associate Director of the Integrated Program in Neuroscience at McGill and is involved with Brain Awareness Week.
